Name of the GUI Application:
Event Scheduler Application
Purpose of the Application:
The application will allow users to schedule and manage personal events or meetings. It will
include features like creating new events, editing existing ones, and viewing upcoming events in
a calendar-like format. The user interface will be simple, intuitive, and designed for easy
interaction, focusing on accessibility.
Reason for Creating the Application:
1. Organizational Efficiency: Many people struggle with organizing their time and events.
This application will help individuals stay on top of important dates and manage their
schedules more effectively.
2. Programming Practice: It will allow me to apply what I've learned about Python, Tkinter,
and GUI design, while also providing hands-on experience in creating a functional, user-
friendly application.
3. Real-World Utility: The application has potential real-world utility for anyone needing to
manage their personal or professional life. It could be expanded for use in businesses or
teams in the future.
Goals for the Application:
1. Create New Events: Users will be able to input event details (name, date, time,
description, etc.) through a user-friendly form.
2. View Scheduled Events: Users can see a calendar or list view of their upcoming events,
and easily identify past or future events.
3. Edit Events: Users will be able to click on an event and modify its details (e.g., change
the time or description).
4. Delete Events: Users should have the option to delete events they no longer need.
5. Event Reminders: Basic reminders can be set for events (notifications or alerts).
6. Intuitive User Interface: Ensure that the GUI is simple and accessible to users with
minimal experience with technology.
7. Data Persistence: Users' events should be saved between sessions (using a file or
database).
Target Audience:
• Age: 18-50 years old
• Gender: All genders
• Socioeconomic Characteristics: Middle-income individuals who are tech-savvy or
familiar with personal organization tools.
• General Interests: People who want to organize their personal events (e.g., appointments,
meetings, social gatherings) but don’t want to use more complex software like Google
Calendar or Outlook.
• User Experience: The app is designed for beginners to intermediate users, with a focus on
simplicity and ease of use.
