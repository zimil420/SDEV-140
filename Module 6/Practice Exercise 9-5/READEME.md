Guessing Game (GUI-based)

This program implements a number-guessing game where the computer attempts to guess 
a number between 1 and 100, and the user provides hints to guide the computer's guesses.
The game uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the correct number.

Features:
- The computer makes a guess and displays it in a label.
- The user provides feedback by clicking one of the buttons: 
    - "Too small" (guess is too low)
    - "Too large" (guess is too high)
    - "Correct" (guess is correct)
- The game disables the buttons when the correct number is found.
- The "New game" button resets the game to start over.

The GUI is built using the `breezypythongui` module.
